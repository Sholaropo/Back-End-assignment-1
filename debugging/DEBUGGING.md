# Debugging Analysis

## Scenario 1: Debugging the Health Check Endpoint Test

-   **Breakpoint Location:** src/test/health.test.ts (Line 15 - Inside the Jest test case for the /api/v1/health endpoint)
-   **Objective:** Verify the behavior of the /api/v1/health endpoint and ensure it returns the correct status code and payload.

### Debugger Observations

-   **Variable States:** 
        res.statusCode: 200
        res.body: {
        "status": "OK",
        "uptime": 584.5572939,
        "timestamp": "2025-01-18T10:01:02.959Z",
        "version": "1.0.0"
        }
-   **Call Stack:** 
        a. The Jest test sends a GET request to /api/v1/health using supertest.
        b. The request is routed to the /api/v1/health handler in app.ts.
        c. The handler constructs a JSON response object (healthCheck) containing server health information.
        d. The handler responds with a 200 status code and the healthCheck JSON object, which is received correctly by the Jest test.
-   **Behavior:** 
        The /api/v1/health handler successfully constructs and returns the health check object with expected values.
        No error was observed during debugging.

### Analysis

-   What did you learn from this scenario?
   Ans: The /api/v1/health endpoint is functioning as intended, returning a 200 status code and a JSON object with the correct structure and values.
-   Did you observe any unexpected behavior? If so, what might be the cause?
     Ans:   No unexpected behavior was observed. The handler and test case executed as expected.
-   Are there areas for improvement or refactoring in this part of the code?
    Ans: Add logging to the /api/v1/health route for easier monitoring in production environments.
-   How does this enhance your understanding of the overall project?
    Ans: It highlights the importance of end-to-end tests for validating application behavior in a controlled environment.
    
## Scenario 2:  Debugging the Routing Logic for API Requests

Breakpoint Location: src/app.ts (Line 20 - Inside the route handler for /api/v1/users)
Objective: Verify that API requests to /api/v1/users are properly processed and routed to the correct handler.
Debugger Observations
Variable States:

**Call Stack:** 

The request is received by express.Router().
Middleware functions are executed (e.g., authentication, logging).
The request is routed to the GET /api/v1/users handler.
The database query is executed, fetching users from the database.
The handler constructs the response object and sends it back.


  **Behavior:** 

The request is successfully routed to the correct handler.
The database query executes as expected, returning a list of users.
The response status and body match expectations.

### Analysis
What did you learn from this scenario?
The API routing logic is functioning correctly, with requests being handled by the appropriate route handlers.


Did you observe any unexpected behavior?
No unexpected behavior was detected. The handler correctly processed the request and returned the expected response.


Are there areas for improvement or refactoring?
Implement better error handling in case of database query failures.

How does this enhance your understanding of the project?
Debugging routing logic reinforces how API requests are processed, ensuring smooth communication between the client and server.

## Scenario 3: [Title of the Scenario]

Breakpoint Location: src/test/auth.test.ts (Line 25 - Inside the Jest test case for the /api/v1/auth/login endpoint)
Objective: Verify that the authentication system correctly validates user credentials and returns the appropriate response.
Debugger Observations

**Call Stack:** 

The Jest test sends a POST request to /api/v1/auth/login with valid credentials.
The authentication middleware verifies that the user exists in the database.
The password is hashed and compared using bcrypt.compareSync().
A JWT token is generated for the authenticated user.
The response is returned with a success message and token.


  **Behavior:** 


The login request successfully validates the user's credentials.
The hashed password comparison executes without errors.
A valid JWT token is generated and returned.


### Analysis
What did you learn from this scenario?
The authentication system is correctly validating users and issuing JWT tokens.


Did you observe any unexpected behavior?
No errors were observed, but in case of an invalid password, a 401 Unauthorized error was properly returned.


Are there areas for improvement or refactoring?
Improve error messages for failed logins 
Implement rate limiting for login attempts to prevent brute force attacks.


How does this enhance your understanding of the project?
Debugging the authentication system reinforces how user verification, password hashing, and token generation work together for secure logins.
