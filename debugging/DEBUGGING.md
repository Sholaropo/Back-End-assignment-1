# Debugging Analysis

## Scenario 1: Debugging the Health Check Endpoint Test

-   **Breakpoint Location:** src/test/health.test.ts (Line 15 - Inside the Jest test case for the /api/v1/health endpoint)
-   **Objective:** Verify the behavior of the /api/v1/health endpoint and ensure it returns the correct status code and payload.

### Debugger Observations

-   **Variable States:** 
        res.statusCode: 200
        res.body: {
        "status": "OK",
        "uptime": 584.5572939,
        "timestamp": "2025-01-18T10:01:02.959Z",
        "version": "1.0.0"
        }
-   **Call Stack:** 
        a. The Jest test sends a GET request to /api/v1/health using supertest.
        b. The request is routed to the /api/v1/health handler in app.ts.
        c. The handler constructs a JSON response object (healthCheck) containing server health information.
        d. The handler responds with a 200 status code and the healthCheck JSON object, which is received correctly by the Jest test.
-   **Behavior:** 
        The /api/v1/health handler successfully constructs and returns the health check object with expected values.
        No error was observed during debugging.

### Analysis

-   What did you learn from this scenario?
   Ans: The /api/v1/health endpoint is functioning as intended, returning a 200 status code and a JSON object with the correct structure and values.
-   Did you observe any unexpected behavior? If so, what might be the cause?
     Ans:   No unexpected behavior was observed. The handler and test case executed as expected.
-   Are there areas for improvement or refactoring in this part of the code?
    Ans: Add logging to the /api/v1/health route for easier monitoring in production environments.
-   How does this enhance your understanding of the overall project?
    Ans: It highlights the importance of end-to-end tests for validating application behavior in a controlled environment.
